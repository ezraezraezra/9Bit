  <li><strong>So what IS 9Bit?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I\'m glad you asked. 9Bit is a video chat web-app game played over any modern browser. The game itself is designed to accommodate up to 3 users. A session is created, friends are invited, fun is had all around.</li>
    	<br />
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How is it used?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Always good to know. If your creating a session, you give yourself a name, the session a name, and them invite your friends to join your session. You pick a color or camera from the palette by clicking on one of the squares on the left hand of the screen. To assign that color / camera feed to one of the big squares, just click on it. Once your done clicking, the 9Bit server updates all user\'s board. Yep, that means you might try to click on a square by your friend could change the color / camera feed of it before you get a chance. </li>
    	<br />
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Sweet. So how was the web app made?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You do like asking the right questions. The web-app 9Bit was developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, JSON, and the OpenTok API. The OpenTok API is what allows your camera to be used as a video feed over the browser. PHP and MySQL are all working their server-side magic in the background without disturbing your experience. HTML, CSS, CSS3, JavaScript, and jQuery are all working their magic on the broswer to give you something usable (and pretty). AJAX and JSON is the glue that binds both sides to give you a seamless web-app.</li>
